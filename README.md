# Airbnb-Price-Prediction 🏠💸

This project predicts nightly Airbnb prices using data cleaning, feature engineering, and machine learning models. It analyzes listing details such as location, property type, amenities, host attributes, and reviews to estimate fair prices. The best results were achieved with XGBoost, outperforming baseline models. This work can help hosts set competitive prices, assist platforms in dynamic pricing, and provide insights for new listings, with scope for future improvements like city-specific models, seasonal features, and deployment as a web app.
